# Phase 2 — plan and progress

Phase 2 is every operation marked **P, phase 2** in `docs/endpoint-catalogue.md` (177 at the start). It is built
in slices, each finishing journeys the POC already demonstrates; a slice is done when its operations are **W**,
its menus in the web app are clickable, and unit, end-to-end and must-deny tests pass on the running stack.

| Slice | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **P2.1** | Dates of exit (member Mark Exit; employer marks, signatory approves), service history, the member's pending / processed applications, Form 13 transfer (member → present employer → DA → AO; ledger moves the balance), Annexure K | **Done** (28 Sep 2026) |
| **P2.2** | Employer member registration (single, bulk; new UAN or a new member ID under an existing one), Form 11, member KYC (PAN, bank) through mock verifiers and the signatory's approval, KYC bulk with error list, missing details, active-member export, the employee's contribution ledger, UAN card, account readiness | **Done** (28 Sep 2026) |
| P2.3 | Pension office and pensioner self-service: pension enquiry, updation activities and tracker, suspend / resume, life-certificate monitoring, PPO, slips, public pension enquiries | |
| P2.4 | Pension settlement: Form 10D, scheme certificate, IDS, worksheet, PPO issue, e-sign, dispatch, initial arrears, CPPS runs, BRS, service aggregation | |
| P2.5 | Death and EDLI claims, CAD, payment scrolls, physical intake, claim documents, cancellations, audit trail | |
| P2.6 | Establishment registration and configuration, Form 5A, branches, DSC / e-sign approvals | |
| P2.7 | Returns, receipts and ledger: arrear / supplementary ECR, demands, direct challans, 14B/7Q knock-offs, VDR rejection, reversals, recredits | |
| P2.8 | The rest: compliance and VISHWAS, international workers, grievance extras, public lookups, audit, NDC, HRM, DO dashboards | |

Operations marked **?** (scope unconfirmed, e.g. *ECR Approval*, *VDR Member Beneficiary*) wait until their
meaning is confirmed.

## P2.1 — how it is built

- **Processes on the engine** (`config/processes/employer-exit.yaml`, `transfer-form13.yaml`). The engine gained
  generic `account` and `date` form rules, checked against a projection of member accounts in workflow-service
  (whose account, at which establishment, exited, already transferred), and `reads` operations (a member's own case).
  `ProcessTransitioned.v1` now says whether the case ended (`terminal`) and whether the member sees it.
- **Owners**: member-service records exits (`MemberExitMarked.v1`) and keeps the member's applications;
  contribution-service posts the transfer journal (`TransferPosted.v1`) and serves Annexure K; claim-service keeps
  its balances and exit dates from those events.
- **Data**: a UAN can now have several member IDs (contribution-service keys members by member ID). Synthetic
  member D has two: AL-0008 (previous, exit not marked) and AL-0009 (current).

## P2.2 — how it is built

- member-service registers joinees (`MemberRegistered.v1` → contribution, claim, workflow) and runs KYC requests:
  a labelled mock verifier (UIDAI / NSDL / penny-drop) answers first, then the employer's signatory approves with
  step-up (DSC / e-sign). An approved KYC changes the member record and publishes `MemberKycUpdated.v1`
  (claim-service updates the PAN flag that sets the TDS rate).
- Deferred from this slice: UAN activation and self-allotment (a login per new member), exit corrections and
  exit-bulk (exits already need the signatory's approval per member), member location mapping (branches, P2.6),
  employer-initiated Joint Declaration.
- Found: interest for a year in which a member ID's balance was later transferred was credited to the emptied
  member ID. It is now credited to the member ID the money went to, and "already credited" is read from the
  interest postings themselves.
